    <h1>Jotter - User Guide</h1>
    <h2>Creating Documents</h2>
    <p>To create a new file, go to the file menu, then new. If this file is anything other than a text file, different colours will show up in the text to distinguish between keywords. Opening files is similar, click on the blue folder - the open icon. You can open more than one by holding down Ctrl as you select each file. Each file will load in adjacent tabs. </p>
    <h2>Saving Documents</h2>
    <p>You can choose to save one file by going to the file menu, then save (or using the Ctrl+S keyboard shortcut). To save all open tabs, click 'save all' on the toolbar. Save all goes through all the tabs and saves each file. </p>
    <h2>Tabs and Closing Tabs</h2>
    <p>Tabs have the file name in them, to close a tab go to the file menu and select 'close'. The Ctrl+Q shortcut does the same thing. Some tabs may be hidden from view, use the little triangle button that appears to cycle through the hidden tabs. Remember, up to 30 files can be loaded at once. </p>
    <h2>Syntax Highlighting</h2>
    <p>This means colouring different parts of text according to rules, such as is it a special programmer's keyword, or a comment? If the file is new, and you wish to try syntax highlighting, go to the options menu, then 'syntax highlighting'. Currently, only 10 programming languages are available to select from. Select the colour theme too. Some people prefer typing with a black background and lighter colours for the writing, others prefer the opposite. Clicking 'update' changes the highlighting for the current tab only. </p>
    <h2>Options</h2>
    <p>You can change the font via the options menu and make it bigger. Any typewriter style fonts you have on your system will be listed (these are also known as monospace fonts). <br />The tab width controls what characters are added to the document when pressing the tab key. By default, pressing tab will add 4 spaces into the file. Only spaces are used here but if a document has existing tabs these will be kept the same. You can set the number to something different by using the 'tab width' option. </p>
